# Backend developer's guidelines

1. Please check the ```<head>``` and the bottom of the ```<body>``` tags of each template for required scripts and stylesheets.
2. Please keep the original html/css/js files for the refference (do not modify them directly).
3. Please keep the same hierarchy, properties, names in order to avoid unwanted errors.
