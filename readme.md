# Backend developer's guidelines

1. Please check the ```<head>``` and the bottom of the ```<body>``` tags of each template for required scripts and stylesheets.
2. Please keep the original html/css/js files for the refference (do not modify them directly).
3. Please keep the same hierarchy, properties, names in order to avoid unwanted errors. 
4. Please note that the best image resolution for sliders at project-inner and type-of-system pages is **1917x1729px** or **1917x1684px**
